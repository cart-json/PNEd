        <p>PNEd is a web-based application specifically developed for the creation, 
            simulation, and analysis of Petri nets. It is designed to facilitate the 
            educational exploration of Petri nets, providing tools for constructing 
            and modifying net structures and observing their behavior. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>File Upload and Save Feature</h2>
        <p>Use the 'Browse' button to upload Petri net files from your computer. 
            After editing or creating your Petri net, use the 'Save' button to download 
            your work as a PNML file.</p>
            
        <br>
        <h2>Interactive Console</h2>
        <p>The console is your main workspace for inputting and analyzing Petri nets. It 
            includes separate fields for adding places, transitions, and edges.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The console simplifies adding elements to your Petri net and supports keyboard 
            shortcuts for efficiency - 'Enter' to trigger analysis and 'Ctrl + Enter' to 
            quickly add new elements</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you press 'Ctrl + Enter' while editing an edge, 
            the place and transition connected by this edge are added to their respective field.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Creating adding places or transitions to the console is only necessary, when they 
            have specific properties (e.g. a label or a initial token). Otherwise, delcaring 
            them in an edge is enough.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Petri Net Visualization Area</h2>
        <p>This area displays visualizes the structure of your net, including places, transitions, 
            and edges, with additional details like arc weights and place capacities when applicable.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Labels Section</h2>
        <p>In the 'Labels' section, you can view and correlate the IDs of transitions with their labels.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Marking Table</h2>
        <p>The Marking Table shows the results of your reachability analysis. It lists various states (markings) 
            of your Petri net, the transitions that can be fired in each state, and the resultant markings. 
            </p>
        <br>
        <p> Click on the blue cells in the table to reveal whether transitions are active or inactive. 
            If it is active you can add the new found marking to the table by clicking on it. 
            But the table also includes an 'Unhide all' option to reveal all the markings at once.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Properties and Analysis Results</h2>
        <p>The 'Properties' section provides insights into the analysis of your Petri net. 
            Here, you can find information about structural soundness, liveness, and other important 
            characteristics of your net. Hovering over these properties may highlight specific related elements.</p>
